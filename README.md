**Required**
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

I think I've managed to hit all the requirements, but no stretch goals.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

The maths on the JS for the arrows took a lot of brainpower - hoping that once we've spent more time on listeners, making things like that will be simpler.

My approach to CSS is a bit too scattergun for my liking. It's very easy to add a bunch of properties and comment them out, rather than know what's going on and add properties deliberately. I'd like that to become more natural, and I need to practice that to achieve that goal.

Learning the difference between class and id was good though, and I anticipate using that frequently in the future.

The logic of functions and callbacks and listeners and handlers is infinitely more understandable now, despite actually making something work taking 3-5 business days.

On a slightly more meta-level of self-reflection, I think, as it's been some time since I was last in education, I'm learning some things about myself that I probably should know by now. Namely, there's some sort of deadline aversion in me, and I'm not sure why that is, or how to tackle it. I've a strong suspicion undiagnosed ADHD might be at work, but that's for a professional.
I pushed the boundary of the Sunday 10pm deadline because I had the knowledge nobody would be looking at this until Tuesday at the latest.
